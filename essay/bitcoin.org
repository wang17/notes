** Abstract
   - A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. （不经过第三方）
   - Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
